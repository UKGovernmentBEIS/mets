  <p class="govuk-body">
    The monitoring plan you create for this source stream using a calculation approach will calculate the amount of CO2e
    emitted during the course of the year based on activity data alongside a number of other calculation parameters.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Biomass fraction is a parameter which can be used as part of your calculation.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Biomass fraction means the ratio of carbon stemming from biomass relative to the total carbon content of a fuel or
    material, expressed as a fraction.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The
    <a govukLink routerLink=".">Monitoring and Reporting Regulations (MRR)</a>
    list the tiers which are expected for carbon content based on considering criteria such as:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your installation category - Category A (low emitter), Category A, B or C</li>
    <li>your source stream category</li>
    <li>the particular fuel or material being used</li>
    <li>the related regulated activity</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    You may not be able to meet the highest tier as required in the MRR. If this is the case you will be asked in
    another section of this permit application to justify if this is due to a technical infeasibility or unreasonable
    cost.
